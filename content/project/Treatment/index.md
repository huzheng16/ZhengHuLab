Metastasis often occurs after adjuvant therapy. Therefore, the post-treated metastasis has gone through strong selection. We leverage large-scale genomic data analysis to infer patient-specific trajectories towards metastatic replase after treatment and interrogate whether current genomic states determine the evolutionary trajectories of metastatic replase.
