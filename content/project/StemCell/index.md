Tissue development and maintenance are instructed by the stem cell differention hierarchy where stem cells lie at the apex. It's known that the stem cell division and differention is highly dynamic in the development of tissues and by impact of environmental stimuli. We combine genetic lineage tracing, single cell transcriptomics and mathematical models to study the clonal dynamics of stem cells during tissue development, renewal and environmental stimuli.
