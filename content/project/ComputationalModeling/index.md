Tumor progression is a complex process invovling extensive spatial and temporal variability and dynamic interteration with microenvironments. We develop agent-based computational models to depict the tumor clonal evolution through space and time. We also leverage multi-region and/or longitudinal genomic data to calibrate the computational model with aims to infer patientâ€™s tumor evolutionary history and quantify the evolutionary dynamics during tumor initiation, progression and metastasis.
