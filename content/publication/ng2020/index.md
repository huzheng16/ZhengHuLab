abstract: Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths, but the natural history, clonal evolution and impact of treatment are poorly understood. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 457 paired primary tumor and metastatic samples from 136 patients with breast, colorectal and lung cancer, including untreated (n = 99) and treated (n = 100) metastases. Treated metastases often harbored private ‘driver’ mutations, whereas untreated metastases did not, suggesting that treatment promotes clonal evolution. Polyclonal seeding was common in untreated lymph node metastases (n = 17 out of 29, 59%) and distant metastases (n = 20 out of 70, 29%), but less frequent in treated distant metastases (n = 9 out of 94, 10%). The low number of metastasis-private clonal mutations is consistent with early metastatic seeding, which we estimated occurred 2–4 years before diagnosis across these cancers. Furthermore, these data suggest that the natural course of metastasis is selectively relaxed relative to early tumorigenesis and that metastasis-private mutations are not drivers of cancer spread but instead associated with drug resistance.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Analysis of WES data from 457 paired primary tumor and metastatic samples in three cancer types reveals early metastatic seeding and the impact of drug treatment on metastatic clonal evolution.
