We harness computational and quantitative genomic approaches to decipher the principles of somatic evolution from precancerous cells to malignant transformation and progression. This involves understanding both the genomic variations and the underlying evolutionary processes that govern cancer initiation/progression and characterize their response to microenvironmental/therapeutic variability and pressure.

Weâ€™re looking for people who share these interests and are looking for graduate students, postdocs, assistant investigators or research assistants to come join us!
