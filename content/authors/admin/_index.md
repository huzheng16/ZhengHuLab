In Hu Lab, we study how plants and climate interact with one another. This involves understanding both the physical climate system and the underlying biological processes that govern ecosystems and characterize their response to environmental variability and change. We use mathematical models and observations to explore ecosystem-climate interaction dynamics and address fundamental questions about the role of biology in the Earth system. Essential to our scientific mission is creating equity by teaching and training informed citizens and the next generation of diverse interdisciplinary climate scientists.
